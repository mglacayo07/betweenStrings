# Between String

If we want to make a generic message we can do something like this "Hello ${name}! your brithday is on ${birthday}"

Imagine that the words between ${this} will be replace with the information, but if we don't have the information it will be send with the ${keys}

This function will replace the words that wasn't replace with a generic message.
